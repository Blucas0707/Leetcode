121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

 

Example 1:

Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
Example 2:

Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
 

Constraints:

1 <= prices.length <= 105
0 <= prices[i] <= 104


# 2 pointer, 用cur 紀錄最小值，每個price 去比對是否是maxprofit

class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        maxprofit = 0
        cur = 0
        for i, price in enumerate(prices):
            if price < prices[cur]:
                cur = i
            else:
                tempProfit = price - prices[cur]
                if tempProfit > maxprofit:
                    maxprofit = tempProfit
        
        return maxprofit
